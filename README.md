# Bungie App - A Candidate Exercise

Hi! Thank you very much for taking a look at my exercise. Below you'll see how to install and run the app.
But first, let me outline what you're going to see.

## Project Overview

_A word about technical choices:_

This app was built with React. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I chose React because:
- It has lightning-fast rendering engine, 
- It's got excellent support for libraries, like the lightweight [Bulma Component library](https://react-bulma.dev/en/) 
- Overall, its suitability for solving these problems in a fun and interactive way.

This exercise consists of two problems.
- _Bungie Boggle_
- _Markdown Converter_

### Bungie Boggle

This is a fun "reduction" of a 9-letter Boggle board, made interactive!
Try entering different combinations of unique letters, then click "Boggle!" and see what words come back.
There might even be a secret hidden in there, if you go hunting!

### Markdown Converter

This is a tool, written from scratch to convert markdown text to HTML.
This was a big challenge! Especially creating custom Regular Expressions to match for unique string sequences, then handle capture groups.
But it proved a very fun and rewarding one. It's super fast too!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
